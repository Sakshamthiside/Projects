#Import needed libraries

import pandas as pd

#Read the Data

Data = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Salary%20Data.csv')

# Model Building

## Varible Selection

# Target Y(Independent variable) and X(Dependent variable)
Y = Data['Salary']

X = Data[['Experience Years']]

Y.shape

X.shape

## Train-Test Split

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, train_size = 0.7, random_state = 2529)

X_train.shape, X_test.shape, Y_train.shape, Y_test.shape

##Model Selection

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()

## Train the Model (fit model)

model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

model.intercept_

model.coef_

##Make Prediction

Y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)

##Accuracy of the Model

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error

mean_absolute_percentage_error(Y_test, Y_predicted)

#**HurrayðŸ¥³! The Model is 96% accurate.**
